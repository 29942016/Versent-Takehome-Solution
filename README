./                          |
    ./node_modules          |
    ./src                   |
        ./configs           | Contains the config files required by this application.
        ./controllers       | Contains the endpoint request & response logic.
        ./middlewares       | Contains interceptors and their logic.
        ./models            | Contains class definitions.
        ./routes            | Contains endpoint routes associated with their controller. 
        ./services          | Contains all business logic for each controller.

Architecture Rationale:
The standard model, view and service architecture was more than sufficient to complete this project.
It provides a simplistic folder heirachy structure that allows for easy modifications and scaling.
